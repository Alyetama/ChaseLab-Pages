## Download the Video From Google Drive

- A video will be assigned to you.  You will recieve an email with a link to the folder that has the video or I will specificly point to a video that you can download.

## Run DeepLabCut GUI

```shell
# On MacOS/Linux open a terminal window. On Windows, open Anaconda Prompt
$ conda activate DLC-CPU
$ pythonw	# on Windows: $ ipython
```

## Create New Project

![](https://i.ibb.co/WfgkVV2/712bdb7d6882.png)
Tab: `Manage Project`
- Type the name of the project and your name.
- Select the video you want to use for the current project.
- Check the first box, then click 'Browse' and choose a directory that you can remember (typically your desktop).
- Check the second box.

## Modify Config File Parameters

- Open your project folder.
- Open `Config.yaml` file.
- Change label names under `bodyparts:` and `skeleton:` (names depend on the current project).
- Change `pcutoff:` to 0.9.

```yaml
# Default config.yaml
# These are the parameters that you will need to change
bodyparts:
- bodypart1
- bodypart2
- objectA
- bodypart3
.
.
.
skeleton:
- - bodypart1
  - bodypart2
- - objectA
  - bodypart3

pcutoff: 0.6
```

## Extract Frames

![](https://i.ibb.co/2nycs1B/9df618f6dbff.png)
Tab: `Extract Frames`
- Keep the defaults then hit "Ok".

![](https://i.ibb.co/wrFDjJ8/8528c491a949.png)
Wait until all processes are completed.  When completed, you will see the following message:

> Frames were successfully extracted.
>
> You can now label the frames using the function 'label_frames' (if you extracted enough frames for all videos).

## Label Frames

![](https://i.ibb.co/y41bsBB/29fe1bd90610.png)
Tab: `Label Frames`
- Click on `Label Frames` button in the bottom.

![](https://i.ibb.co/rsp2vwG/593f8d070614.png)

- Label the body parts.
- When you are done, `save` then `quit`.

![](https://i.ibb.co/y41bsBB/29fe1bd90610.png)
- Click on `check labels`.
- Close DeepLabCut interface, then hit `CTRL+C` in your terminal.


## Change Paths

Next, we will change all the paths in the configuration file to match the cluster's.
- Open your project folder.
- Open `Config.yaml` file.
- Change the paths under `project_path:` and `video_sets` to match the cluster's directory.  For example:

The following paths
```yaml
# Example
project_path: /Users/Duck/Desktop/data/catcatcatgo/may20_catcat_10-08-2020

video_sets:
  /Users/Duck/Desktop/data/catcatcatgo/may20_catcat_10-08-2020/videos/cat.mp4:
```

will be changed to:
```yaml
# Example
project_path: /work/chaselab/<username>/may20_catcat_10-08-2020

video_sets:
  /work/chaselab/<username>/may20_catcat_10-08-2020/videos/cat.mp4:
```

:::note
On windows, make sure you change all back slashes "\" to forward slashes "/"
:::

- Save and close.


## Upload Your Project Folder to Google Drive

- Open your school's account on Google Drive.
- Drag and drop the folder to the same shared folder you downloaded the video from.
- Wait for the upload to complete.


## Log in to the Cluster

- Now log in to the cluster:

```shell
$ ssh <username>@crane.unl.edu
```

- Call your "DLC environment kit":
```shell
$ source i.sh
```

## Copy Your Project Folder to the Cluster

You will use Rclone to copy your project folder from Google Drive to the cluster.  Do this by running:

```shell
$ rclone --drive-shared-with-me copy drive:</path/to/project> ./<project>
```

:::note
The `</path/to/project>` can be viewed at the top of the Google Drive page.
:::

For example, this:

![](https://i.ibb.co/7nFK8r3/01f91b410257.png)

will be:

```shell
# Example
$ rclone --drive-shared-with-me copy drive:may20/catcat_10-08-2020 ./<project>
```


### Copy to Shared
- When the folder is downloaded to the cluster, make a copy to `chaselab` group's shared folder.  To do this, simply run:

```shell
$ cp $WORK/<project> /work/chaselab/shared/toxo-project/DLC-DATA-SHARE/<project>
```

export const Highlight = ({children, color}) => ( <span style={{
      backgroundColor: color,
      borderRadius: '2px',
      color: '#000000',
      padding: '0.2rem',
    }}> {children} </span> );

<br />


&nbsp;&nbsp;<Highlight color="#FAE000"><strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;Done!&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</strong></Highlight>

<iframe src="https://toxoproject.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/cat_swinging.html" scrolling="no" frameborder="0" height="500px" width="350px"></iframe>


export const Highlight2 = ({children, color}) => ( <span style={{
      backgroundColor: color,
      borderRadius: '2px',
      color: '#525252',
      padding: '0.2rem',
      fontSize: '10px',
    }}> {children} </span> );

<br />
<br />
<br />
