## Download the Video From Google Drive

- A video will be assigned to you.  You will recieve an email with a link to the folder that has the video or I will specificly point to a video that you can download.

## Run DeepLabCut GUI

```shell
# On MacOS/Linux open a terminal window. On Windows, open Anaconda Prompt
$ conda activate DLC-CPU
$ pythonw	# on Windows: $ ipython
```
```python
>>> import deeplabcut
>>> deeplabcut.launch_dlc()
```

## Create New Project

![](https://i.ibb.co/WfgkVV2/712bdb7d6882.png)
Tab: `Manage Project`
- Type the name of the project and your name.
- Select the video you want to use for the current project.
- Check the first box, then click 'Browse' and choose a directory that you can remember (typically your desktop).
- Check the second box.

## Modify Config File Parameters

- Open your project folder.
- Open `Config.yaml` file.
- Change label names under `bodyparts:` and `skeleton:` (names depend on the current project).
- Change `pcutoff:` to 0.9.

```yaml
# Default config.yaml
# These are the parameters that you will need to change
bodyparts:
- bodypart1
- bodypart2
- objectA
- bodypart3
.
.
.
skeleton:
- - bodypart1
  - bodypart2
- - objectA
  - bodypart3

pcutoff: 0.6
```

## Extract Frames

![](https://i.ibb.co/2nycs1B/9df618f6dbff.png)
Tab: `Extract Frames`
- Keep the defaults then hit "Ok".

![](https://i.ibb.co/wrFDjJ8/8528c491a949.png)
Wait until all processes are completed.  When completed, you will see the following message:

> Frames were successfully extracted.
>
> You can now label the frames using the function 'label_frames' (if you extracted enough frames for all videos).

## Label Frames

![](https://i.ibb.co/y41bsBB/29fe1bd90610.png)
Tab: `Label Frames`
- Click on `Label Frames` button in the bottom.

![](https://i.ibb.co/rsp2vwG/593f8d070614.png)

- Label the body parts.
- When you are done, `save` then `quit`.

## Build Skeleton
Tab: `Label Frames`

- Click on `Build Skeleton` button in the bottom.
- Drag your mouse on the points in the correct order to draw a line that defines the skeleton.
- Hit `Export`, then close the window.

- Close DeepLabCut interface, then hit `CTRL+C` in your terminal.


## Clean Labeled Data

- Open the `.csv` file under your project folder → labeled-data → video-name folder → `CollectedData<name>.csv`.
- If you skipped any frame, you will notice that some rows have no data.
- Delete any image that does not have any data in the .csv file (the images name are in the first column of the .csv file, and the actual images can be found under the same folder you found your .csv file in).
- When you are done deleting the actual images (don't edit the .csv file!), open a new terminal window and run the following:

```shell
$ conda activate DLC-CPU
$ pythonw  # on Windows: $ ipython
```
```python
>>> import deeplabcut
>>> cfg = '<config_file_path>'
>>> deeplabcut.dropannotationfileentriesduetodeletedimages(cfg)
```


## Change Paths

Next, we will change all the paths in the configuration file to match the cluster's.
- Open your project folder.
- Open `Config.yaml` file.
- Change the paths under `project_path:` and `video_sets` to match the cluster's directory.  For example:

The following paths
```yaml
# Example
project_path: /Users/Duck/Desktop/data/catcatcatgo/may20_catcat_10-08-2020

video_sets:
  /Users/Duck/Desktop/data/catcatcatgo/may20_catcat_10-08-2020/videos/cat.mp4:
```

will be changed to:
```yaml
# Example
project_path: /work/chaselab/DLC-DATA/<username>/may20_catcat_10-08-2020

video_sets:
  /work/chaselab/DLC-DATA/<username>/may20_catcat_10-08-2020/videos/cat.mp4:
```

:::note
On windows, make sure you change all back slashes "\" to forward slashes "/".
:::

- Save and close.


## Upload Your Project Folder to Google Drive

- Open your school's account on Google Drive.
- Drag and drop the folder to the same shared folder you downloaded the video from.
- Wait for the upload to complete.


## Log in to the Cluster

- Now log in to the cluster:

```shell
$ ssh <username>@crane.unl.edu
```

- Call your "DLC environment kit":
```shell
$ source i.sh
```

- Start a tmux session.
```shell
$ tmux  # if you have an active tmux session, run: $ tmux a
```

## Copy Your Project Folder to the Cluster

You will use Rclone to copy your project folder from Google Drive to the cluster.  Do this by running:

```shell
$ rclone --drive-shared-with-me copy drive:</path/to/project> ./<project>
```

:::note
The `</path/to/project>` can be viewed at the top of the Google Drive page.
:::

For example, this:

![](https://i.ibb.co/7nFK8r3/01f91b410257.png)

will be:

```shell
# Example
$ rclone --drive-shared-with-me copy drive:may20/catcat_10-08-2020 ./<project>
```


### Copy to Shared
- When the folder is downloaded to the cluster, make a copy to `chaselab` group's shared folder.  To do this, simply run:

```shell
$ cp $WORK/<project> /work/chaselab/shared/toxo-project/DLC-DATA-SHARE/<project>
```

export const Highlight = ({children, color}) => ( <span style={{
      backgroundColor: color,
      borderRadius: '2px',
      color: '#000000',
      padding: '0.2rem',
    }}> {children} </span> );

<br />


&nbsp;&nbsp;<Highlight color="#FAE000"><strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;Done!&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</strong></Highlight>

<iframe src="https://toxoproject.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/cat_swinging.html" scrolling="no" frameborder="0" height="500px" width="350px"></iframe>


export const Highlight2 = ({children, color}) => ( <span style={{
      backgroundColor: color,
      borderRadius: '2px',
      color: '#525252',
      padding: '0.2rem',
      fontSize: '10px',
    }}> {children} </span> );

<br />
<br />
<br />
